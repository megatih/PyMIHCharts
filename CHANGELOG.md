## [3.2.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Interactive Status Bar**: Enhanced the status bar to display color-coded, real-time indicator values (BB, TD) synchronized with the user's mouse position on the chart.
- **Compact Formatting**: Refined both the chart legend and status bar with professional abbreviations (O, H, L, C, M, U, L, S, C) to maximize data visibility and reduce UI clutter.

### Changed
- **Data Synchronization**: Improved the controller logic to ensure the parent chart container's dataset is updated during indicator recalculations, enabling immediate hover-data availability for newly enabled bands.
- **Visual Consistency**: Standardized the delimiter and spacing between legend and status bar elements for a unified professional appearance.
